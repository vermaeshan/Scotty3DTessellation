## Objective
Though we implemented various sub-division schemes as part of the assignment, techniques like PN triangle method and Phong tessellation better approximate curves through bezier surfaces. By allowing the user to specify tessellation factor, the aim to implement hardware tessellation in software.

##Tessellation Theory
The tessellation is the process that divides a polygon into smaller ones. Another definition is: tessellation allows to increase polygons density. Today tessellation can be done on GPU and provides several key benefits:

+**Compression**: using tessellation allows to reduce the memory footprint and bandwidth consumption by storing on disk only low resolution meshes.

+**Bandwidth** is improved because, instead of transferring all of the vertex data for a high-polygon mesh over the PCI-E bus, only the coarse mesh is sent to the GPU.

+**Scalability**: because of its recursive nature, subdivision naturally accommodates LOD rendering and adaptive approximation with a variety of metrics.

While tessellation can be done on hardware, it will be useful to see how the final output will look.

### PN Triangle Test
From the input vertices and normals, Curved PN Triangles [[Vlachos et al. 2001]](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/SurfLab/papers/00ati.pdf) generates
control points to represent a smooth, cubic Bezier triangle that interpolates across the three
input vertices.

The cubic Bezier triangle can be evaluated given these control points with the following formula 

![t](https://github.com/vermaeshan/Scotty3DTessellation/blob/master/images/pn-eq.png?raw=true)

The control points are generated by interpolating geometric vertex locations, and projecting
them along their nearest normal, and in the case of the center control point, the averaged
normal. The formulae for generating these control points are given in the appendix.

###Phong Tessellation
Phong Tessellation draws inspiration from Phong Shading, a method that shades boundary
representations smoothly by interpolating normals used for lighting calculations. Phong
Tessellation [[Boubekeur and Alexa 2008]](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~boubek/papers/PhongTessellation/PhongTessellation.pdf) generates tangent planes for each input vertex,
aligned to each input normal, and performs barycentric interpolation within the three defining
tangent planes of a triangle to find a newly generated point.
This process is illustrated in Figure. A newly generated vertex p is projected onto the three
tangent planes, shown by the dotted green lines. The new vertex location p* is found by
barycentric interpolation of the tangent plane projections.

We can define the projection operation of a point q onto the tangent plane associated with
vertex `vi` and normal `ni`

![t](https://github.com/vermaeshan/Scotty3DTessellation/blob/master/images/phong-eq.png?raw=true)

Given this projection, we can find the new location `p*` of an input vertex `p` by a simple matrix
multiplication

## Steps
1. Add an interface for Tessellation. Te process will be two step:
    + To get in to Tessellation mode and define Tessellation Factor/Specify Method.
    + Run Tessellation and Display Output
2. Code Up PN Triangle and Phong Tessellation. 
    + This should be similar to Catmull-Clark implementation.
